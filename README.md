<title>Nutrition Tracker</title>

<h1>Nutrition Tracker</h1>

<h3>Why:</h3>

<p>I decided to make a desktop nutrition tracker. Tracking my eating is something that I have done for the last 5 years 
in order to maximize my strength and muscle gains at the gym. I currently use MyFitnessPal on my phone, but it 
would be convenient to have a desktop application as well.</p>

<p>This project would be suited to those who want to lose weight, gain weight, or just become more aware of the food 
that they are putting in their bodies.</p>

<h3>Functions:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Create and save recipes for reuse</li>
    <li>Track kcal, protein, carbs, and fat</li>
    <li>Calculate maintenance kcal for user height and weight</li>
    <li>Change kcal goal depending on desired weight-loss/weight-gain</li>
    <li>Input exercise to adjust kcal for the day</li>
    <li>Create and save foods for reuse</li>
    <li>Create and save workouts for reuse</li>

</ul>
