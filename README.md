<h1>FitTrack</h1>

<h3>Why:</h3>

<p>I decided to make a desktop nutrition tracker. Tracking my eating is something that I have done for the last 5 years 
in order to maximize my strength and muscle gains at the gym. I currently use MyFitnessPal on my phone, but it 
would be convenient to have a desktop application as well.</p>

<p>This project would be suited to those who want to lose weight, gain weight, or just become more aware of the food 
that they are putting in their bodies.</p>

 <h4>User Stories</h4>

    </ul>
